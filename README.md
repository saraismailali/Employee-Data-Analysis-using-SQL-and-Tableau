# Employee-Data-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Tableau

Incorporating SQL, I crafted a query to extract pertinent data for generating the following dashboard in Tableau:

**Task 1**: Develop a visualization delineating the distribution of male and female employees by year, commencing from 1990. This was manifested as a bar chart.

**Task 2**: Contrast the quantity of male and female managers across various departments annually, commencing from 1990. This was illustrated as an area chart.

**Task 3**: Compare the mean salary of male versus female staff across the entire organization until the year 2002. Additionally, integrate a filter enabling the examination of this comparison per department. This was depicted as a line chart.

**Task 4**: Construct an SQL stored procedure facilitating the retrieval of average salaries for males and females per department within a specified salary range. This range is user-defined through two parameters passed when invoking the procedure. The visual representation of this information is presented as a double bar chart.
